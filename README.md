# HRV

## Scope of Project
Personal project to apply concepts from UW Madison ECE 203 and ECE 330.

Analyze ECG data from the [MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database](https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/) with Python using the predeveloped package [wfdb](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as well as custom code. Learn about HRV processing decisions from resources listed below.

### Steps
1) Import ECG data into Python
2) Time Domain Analysis 

    a) Find RR intervals using Pan and and Tompkinâ€™s QRS detector
    
4) Frequency Domain Analysis

    a) Re-sample RR
    
    b) Fourier Transform
    
    c) PSD
    
5) Compare results with those [found here](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/functions/hrv.html).
