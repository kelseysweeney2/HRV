# HRV
Personal project to apply concepts from UW Madison ECE 203 and ECE 330.

## Scope of Project
Analyze ECG data from the [MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database](https://physionet.org/content/nsrdb/1.0.0/) with Python using the predeveloped package [wfdb](https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as well as custom code. Learn about HRV processing decisions from the following resources:
